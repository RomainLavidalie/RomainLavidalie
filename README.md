# Romain Lavidalie

Hi, I'm Romain ! I'm an aspiring video game developer, currently studying at Cnam-Enjmin.

I mainly have experience in **C#**, **Javascript** and **Python**. I love to program tools and simple programs that can automate processes from my everyday life.
I'm also into gameplay programming and game design !
